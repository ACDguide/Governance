## UNDER DEVELOPMENT

### Draft ideas

#### Potential 'start' points

- You have 'raw' data (e.g. model output) that is not ready for publication, and requires reformatting and metadata input.

- You have performed analysis/evaluation/etc on published/replicated data, and want to publish your derived results/data.

#### Potential use cases

- These are for 'CREATE':

    - For yourself!

    - You want to share your data with colleagues and throughout your institution for collaboration but not citation. Basic needs.

- These are for 'PUBLISH'
    - You want to publish data that underpins a manuscript publication (i.e. supporting data). Standard publication needs.

    - You want to publish data into a large multi-institutional inter-comparison project (e.g. CORDEX-CMIP6). Must meet strict standards.
