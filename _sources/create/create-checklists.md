# Checklists for data management in the project lifecycle

These checklists represent what a dataset evolution might look like at different stages of a project.
The checklists consider three different stages of a project:
* just starting
* project consolidation
* sharing and publishing

The different views of the list highlight in `yellow` what should be accomplished at each stage and in `blue` what should have already happened.

Not all of these actions will have the same relevance for different projects and some datasets might need further specific actions.
