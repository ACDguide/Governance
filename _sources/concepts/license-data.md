# Dataset license
While we consider both datasets and code as a form of data, from a licensing point of view they are treated differently. For datasets we suggest the Creative Commons licenses (CC). As well as the international version, there is also an Australian Creative Commons. These licenses are simple to use, they offer 6 different flavours, which cover most use cases and an online tool to help you choose between them. They have a human-readable version as well as the legal text and finally, the International version was created to cover your data independently of the potential user's country of origin.

Creative Commons use abbreviation for each of the options:

* BY - for attribution which is always present, the right to distribute is also implicit in any CC license
* NC - for not commercial
* SA - for share alike
* ND - for not derivatives

```{warning} Non-commercial license
In the last few years there is a push to avoid using the Not Commercial clause as this can have unexpected ramifications. For example, if you use some data or an image for a presentation at a conference that people have to pay to attend, this could be considered Commercial use.
```

## How to apply a license
Once you have decided which license to apply it is usually fairly easy to apply it to your dataset or code.

If publishing a dataset set you can create a license.txt file which contains the chosen license legal text.

At the top of the file specify the dataset title ( referred to as "licensed material") and the owner of the work you are licensing (referred to as "licensor"). Please note that in the example below CLEX is acting as licensor on behalf of the author and/or their institution.

You can see the license online at

 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode

```{note} Example license header
 Licensor - ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes (CLEX) - Level 4, Mathews Building, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 2052, Phone: +61 2 9385 9393, e-mail coecss@unsw.edu.au
 Author: "author name" <"author-email">
  Licensed Material - <dataset title> (version 1.0)
  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons ....
```
The license.txt file then will be available both in the dataset local directory and on the NCI dataset catalogue together with the files. Also, we will use the appropriate license link to the Creative Commons website in the files global attributes and in the metadata records we produce.

It is important that whichever license you choose the owner, author and title of the work are clear, including the source in case of a derived work. This is the information that anyone who wants to use your work should be using to generate a correct attribution. Even better, you should be providing the preferred citation text yourself.
