The Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau) considers data and information to be critical national assets that must be managed effectively. 

The Bureau's Data and Information Management Policy sets out the requirements to ensure consistent and proper management of data and information and are underpinned by relevant procedures. 

The Bureau's Data and Information Management Policy applies to all Bureau staff (including students, volunteers, contractors and consultants), and to all Bureau data and information. This includes data that is created or used as part of Bureau research and projects. 

The Bureau's data principles align with best practice incorporating whole-of-government and international obligations and standards. The principles are outlined in [Data 2022 and Beyond](http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/Data-2022-and-beyond.pdf) (page 6).

Bureau of Meteorology staff can access further guidance from the Data Governance Office. 

The Bureau's standard [Disclaimer](http://www.bom.gov.au/other/disclaimer.shtml?ref=ftr) and [Copyright](http://www.bom.gov.au/other/copyright.shtml) apply.
