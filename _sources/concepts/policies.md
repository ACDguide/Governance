# Data policies
Each institution has their own data policy and data services they have to provide to publish and/or archive data. This can create confusion as a researcher might have to follow, for the same dataset, a journal publishing requirements, their own institution policy, the funder policy, usually the Australian Research Council, and potentially follow a project specific guidelines. Sometimes an institution might require you to do something which is not possible, as publishing model data on their repository when this does not have capacity for a large dataset.

The key to navigate  all these policies and services is to remember that all these reccomendation and rules have a common aim. The Australian Research Council (ARC), your own institution and/or government organisation usually want your data to be FAIR. They want you to:

* share and publish your data and code whenever possible;
* to do this ethically (see Research Code of Conduct);
* to use a repository, standards and conventions relevant to your discipline; 
* and to archive for 5 years essential data underpinning your PhD thesis and journal publications.
