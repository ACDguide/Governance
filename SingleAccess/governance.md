## Statement of scope

The aim of the portal is to provide one place where you can query and find datasets used in climate research which are available in Australia.

We do not store any data on this portal, each record provides:
- A brief description of the dataset
- Link to the official metadata record and point of access for the dataset, where these exist
- Any other relevant link, ie review of the dataset on another website, training material associated to the dataset
- Files that provide a commentary, review, code associated to the dataset can be attached to the record, these will be available for download after the portal admin have reviewed them

As well as datasets we also want to create records for:
 * Climate related data portals
 * Climate data collections
 * Software projects and codes related to analysis of climate data
 * Projects which are producing climate data which is not yet published (to foster collaboration)
…
