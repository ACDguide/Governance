# Guidelines to create a climate data product

## UNDER DEVELOPMENT

So far, the guidelines have focused on creating, managing, and publishing climate research data with a climate science researcher as end-user. However, climate data is often used in other research fields, government initiatives and by private stakeholders for a variety of applications.
The process to adapt and package climate data so that be of use to a wider audience, with different backgrounds and/or for different purposes is more complex than simply sharing data with other climate researchers. We know of research projects that had put together climate data products and we expect agency such as CSIRO and the Bureau of meteorology to do this on a regular basis, however there's no best practice documented available.
This guideline aims to outline the extra steps to consider when creating a climate data product which is fit to be distributed. It is important to provide enough documentation and quality control so that a non-expert audience can use the data correctly and trust can be built and maintained in the product itself. It is also important to offer a product which is of the right format and accessible to the targeted users.

This is a new guideline and we welcome input and contributions from anyone who is interested and/or has experience in providing climate data products.
 

### Potential outline

Here is list of steps to consider:

* Preprocessing
  * Data Collection and Preprocessing
  * Data Bias Correction
  * Quality Control and Validation

* Formatting
  * Spatial and Temporal Subset
  * Spatial Interpolation
  * Data Aggregation and Averaging
  * Convert to appropriate format

* Create User-Friendly Climate Products
  * User-centric documentation
  * Data Visualization and Analysis

* Data Distribution and Sharing
  * Select appropriate platform/s
  * Continual Update and Improvement
  * Copyright, license, disclaimer and other terms of use
