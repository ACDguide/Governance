# Guidelines to create a climate dataset

## UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Scope of the guidelines

These guidelines cover the various aspects to creating robust and well-described climate data for reuse, analysis, sharing, and publication.

We have identified four primary use cases that guide the recommendations and requirements you should follow when creating your climate datasets:  
1. for your own reuse and analysis (basic dataset recommendations)  
2. sharing with colleagues for collaboration (minimum sharing recommendations, no citation necessary)
3. for publication alongside a research paper (journal requirements apply)
4. for publication into a large multi-institutional intercomparison project like CMIP (strict standards apply)

Additionally, we have identified two main situations you may find yourself in: i) preparing your datasets from scratch (i.e. you have 'raw' data that is currently undescribed, and in a format that is not analysis-ready); or ii) deriving metrics or indices from a reference dataset (e.g. performing an analysis on CMIP data for a research publication). We will mostly be discussing the first situation where you are creating climate data from scratch, with specific recommendatations for the second situation at the end of the section.
