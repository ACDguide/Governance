# Guidelines to create a climate dataset
Often new datasets start as a by product of a research project, as a consequence there is no much planning in regard to the files themselves. It is important instead to start thinking of how the way we are structuring the files will impact their usability, accessibility etc. In short we should be concerned about producing FAIR data from the start of the process.

## Scope of the guidelines
 This section aims to give tips on how to create and organise your data in a way that will make it easier to analyse it and, later on, to share it with others and/or publish it.
