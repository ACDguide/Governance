# Guidelines to create a climate dataset

## UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Scope of the guidelines

These guidelines cover the various aspects to creating robust and well-described climate data for reuse, analysis, sharing, and publication.

We have identified four primary use cases that guide the recommendations and requirements you should follow when creating your climate datasets:  
1. for your own reuse and analysis (basic dataset needs)  
2. sharing with colleagues for collaboration (minimum sharing recommendations, no citation necessary)
3. for publication alongside a research paper (journal requirements apply)
4. for publication into a large multi-institutional intercomparison project like CMIP (strict standards apply)

Additionally, we have identified two main situations you may find yourself in: i) preparing your datasets from scratch (i.e. you have 'raw' data that is currently undescribed, and in a format that is not analysis-ready); or ii) deriving metrics or indices from a reference dataset (e.g. performing an analysis on CMIP data for a research publication). We will mostly be discussing the first situation where you are creating climate data from scratch, with specific recommendatations for the second situation later in the section.
