# Retiring replicated data

Replicated data is usually retired to prioritise storage usage, occasionally because the data is flawed.

If the data contains a serious error you might want to block access to it as early as possible, as for published data. It might be useful to aslo remove access but not the data immediately or archived the data for a limited amount of time for reporducibility reason. However, as you are not the primary publisher it should generally be ok to remove the data entirely eventually.

If the data needs t be retired to prioritise storage usage, then it is more complicated.
This is because it is hard in the first place to choose which data, or data subset, to retire, as this is based on your community needs.


## How to asses data usage

### automated methods
These can be useful when managing a big dataset where you have set rules from the start, so that ongoing retirement of data subsets are anticipated and part of the regular management
* last accessed date
* database queries
* online downloads

### community feedback
* email communication , ie using my.nci.org.au to contact projects' users. This might be sufficinet when you have already identified a likely candidate
* survey, can be useful when you need to evaluate several datasets at one time, or work out which subset of a a big dataset could be retired
