## Further information

[DataCite](https://support.datacite.org/docs/what-is-a-doi) provides the authoritative guidance on DOIs and associated processes.

Each data publisher should have a policy on how to manage data withdrawals. Some examples are provided here.

- [CSIRO DAP "Withdraw a Public Collection"](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/dap/Withdraw+a+Public+Collection) (visible to CSIRO staff only) retains data on the system but permits limiting visibility.
- NCI's policy is not known/not publicly available at this time.
- [Zenodo "Removal" policy](https://about.zenodo.org/policies/) views withdrawal as an "exceptional action" and serves a Tombstone page in the place of the original landing page.
- [Figshare](https://help.figshare.com/article/can-i-edit-or-delete-my-research-after-it-has-been-made-public) permits versioning but not deletion.
- [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/faq) views data removal as an "exceptional action" which should only occur "if there are concerns over privacy or data ownership".
- The Australian Ocean Data Network does not have a public policy on data withdrawal but uses the same method as many other publishers of retaining all data but using versioning where required. They strongly discourage uploading data until the researcher is positive it is in its final state.
- [University of Reading (UK)](https://researchdata.reading.ac.uk/preservation_policy.html) withdraw data from public view but do not delete, and use versions. [Birkbeck (UK)](https://researchdata.bbk.ac.uk/policies.html#withdrawalpolicy) have a similar policy.

In all cases, the course of action if needing to remove a published dataset is to contact the data publishing host (NCI, CSIRO etc) and discuss how to proceed on their platform, as well as any errata requirements to populate the Tombstone page.

The first case defines the updated dataset as being a new *version* of the data (e.g. v1 -> v2) which would require a new DOI if published. The second case reflects what in software would be considered a *minor release* (e.g. v1.1), it will attract a new metadata record but not a new dataset version number or DOI. The final case may require a full retraction of the original data and metadata, moving any publication landing page to a "tombstone page" and archiving the data, with a new DOI being minted for the updated dataset.
