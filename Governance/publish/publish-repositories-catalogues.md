# Data repositories, catalogues and records
Once your data is created and ready for publication, you will need to decide **where** to publish it. There are two main components of this decision: DOI/catalogue record, and data location. Note that these may be the same, but not necessarily.

For each dataset, a DOI must be generated, which creates a persistent identifier and functions similar to a journal article DOI. Along with the DOI, you will need to include metadata-level details about the dataset, including: author list, license, geospatial extent, etc.

Additionally, each dataset must be stored either in a repository, or available through a web server (e.g. THREDDS, OpenDAP). 

In this section we will cover the main data catalogues and repositories. Most (many?) of these options can store your data for open access, mint DOIs, and provide landing pages for the publication record.

### CSIRO DAP
CSIRO-only, data upload (<1TB), DOI mint/service record. Bowen Research Cloud for OpenDAP access a possibility for larger datasets.

### Zenodo
Public, CLEX library, data service, DOI mint/service record?

### NCI data catalogue / managed data collections
NCI-managed only, OpenDAP access through NCI project on Gadi, DOI mint/service record

### figshare
Public, data service, DOI mint/service record?
