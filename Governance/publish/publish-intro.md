# Guidelines to publish climate data

## Scope of the guidelines
This guidelines are covering the main steps involved in publishing a climate dataset.
They illustrate how to prepare a dataset for publication, what you want to include both in the dataset itself and in the metadata that will be created for the publication. What are the common requirement for a dataset to publication ready and what are th specific requirements based on the publisher. As this is looking at the Australian context we focused on the institutions we know of that publish climate data. If you are aware of others we didn't covert please contact us by creating an issue.
