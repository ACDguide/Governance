# Guidelines to publish climate data

These guidelines are covering the main steps involved in publishing a climate dataset.
We tried to list the publishing options available to climate researchers in Australia, based on their organisation and the type of data to publish. 
We then covered some of these options in detail, highlighting how to prepare a dataset for publication, what to include both in the dataset itself and in the metadata record.
We focused on institutions and projects we know of that publish climate data. If you are aware of others that we didn't cover please contact us by creating an issue.
