# CSIRO Data Access Portal (DAP) 

Data, software and links to external data holdings (such as NCI) can be added to the [CSIRO Data Access Portal](https://data.csiro.au/) (DAP) by **CSIRO staff** only. More information on creating metadata records and uploading files to the CSIRO DAP can be found on the [DAP Help Guide](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/dap/Deposit+and+Manage+Data) (staff only access).

 CSIRO-affiliated data can be published in the DAP and the lead creator does not have to be CSIRO staff member.

!!!COMMENT: at the moment this is identical to what we have in the Publishing option pages for CSIRO. I'm leaving this here for the moment in case we want to add something more, like:
 - summary of the procedure with pros and cons? 
 - Something which is not covered in the official documentation but could be useful?  
 - a reminder to follow discipline specific best practices even if they aren't necessarily required?
