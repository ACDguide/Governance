# CSIRO Data Access Portal (DAP) 

Data, software and links to external data holdings (such as NCI) can be added to the [CSIRO Data Access Portal](https://research.csiro.au/dap/) (DAP) by **CSIRO staff** only. More information on creating metadata records and uploading files to the CSIRO DAP can be found on the [DAP Help Guide](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/dap/Publish%2C+Archive%2C+and+Manage+Research+Data+and+Software) (staff only access).

 CSIRO-affiliated data can be published in the DAP and the lead creator does not have to be CSIRO staff member.
