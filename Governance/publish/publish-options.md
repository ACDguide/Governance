# Publishing options
Once your data is created and ready for publication, you will need to decide **where** to publish it. 

One of the main factors is what services are available to you, this is largely determined by your own institution and/or organization.
In some case you might have the option of contributing to a large-scale project that has its own publishing procedure established.
Here we are covering the most common use cases for our community.

## BoM

## CSIRO

Data, software and links to external data holdings (such as NCI) can be added to the [CSIRO Data Access Portal](https://data.csiro.au/) (DAP) by **CSIRO staff** only. More information on creating metadata records and uploading files to the CSIRO DAP can be found on the [DAP Help Guide](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/dap/Deposit+and+Manage+Data) (staff only access).

 CSIRO-affiliated data can be published in the DAP and the lead creator does not have to be CSIRO staff member.

## CLEX or university
We are looking here at CLEX as an example but as basically CLEX is only a collaboration project among universities, a lot of what applies here it is also usually applicable if you work/study in another university. If you are part of CLEX or you work for a university you have potentially more freedom in terms of where you can publish your data. Unless you are working in a project which is covered by a data agreement and has specific licensing and/or data distribution requirements, the approach is to follow the FAIR principle and you are usually expected to share your data openly.
  
### CLEX Data Collection on NCI
This is the best option if you have data in NetCDF format and this data could be useful for other researchers. We will help you document your data and make it user friendly; it will be part of a climate data collection and so it will be easier to discover. NCI also has more storage capacity than other repositories and services which are designed around the NetCDF format.

### Institutional repository

  This is adequate if you have a small dataset and it is really specific to your study or only a subset/post processing of another dataset. While institutions offer some data curation, they usually will not check that the data is well described, consistent and user friendly, so you might get a DOI for your record but no added value. If your dataset is bigger than 50-100 GB, you might not be able to publish it with one of these repositories.

### Zenodo, Figshare, Mendeley

  These services are free, and you can create your own account, a record for your data and get a DOI fairly easily and quickly. You can also publish here different kind of materials. This can be useful if you want to publish some very specific data, for example code and data to produce a specific figure required to publish a paper. 

However, there are no standards required or anyone checking on your metadata. This means that it is up to you to make sure your data is as FAIR as possible. This means Findable, which is harder when your record is not part of a discipline repository or collection or you haven't used keywords in an effective manner. And Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, which means the data should have enough metadata, use discipline standards and be properly described.

Finally, as for institutional repositories, the data size is limited to 50 GB and you will not get any additional data services apart from HTTP download. If you decide to go this way, please make sure you document your data properly, we are happy to provide support and review your record. If you use Zenodo, you can easily add your record to our Data Collection (see below)

## Discipline specific data portal

In some cases your data might be fit to be published to a specific data portal or as part of a laerger intiative.
Of these we are covering only the ESGF case more closely, as it provides an example of a comprehensive publishing process. For the others you can refer to their websites for more information but we also added some examples of datasets climate community members published.
Keep in mind that some of these options can be an extra distribution option for your data even if it is already published elsewhere.

[ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov) - the Earth System Grid Federation is a collaborative project responsible for the publication and distribution of climate model output as CMIP, CORDEX and other associated datasets. We are covering in detail the [procedure to publish CMIP and CORDEX data with ESGF](publish-esgf.md) (usually via NCI). Even if you are not contributing officially to one of these projects, the post-processing part of this procedure can still be applicable to generic ACCESS model output or "unofficial" CORDEX simulations. It also provide a good overview of what you should consider when publishing any kind of model output, in particular at a collaborative project level.
