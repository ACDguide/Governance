# Choosing keywords

There are few categories you should try to cover when assigning keywords:

* dataset acronym: if your data is strictly related to another dataset, or your code is applied to a specific dataset
* model acronym and version: as for datasets if you generated the data using a model
* project acronym: if your dataset and or code relates to a specific project 
* programming language:  you should add this to your code records and be as specific as possible, for example use python3, rather than just python
* data type: observation, model output, etc.
* realm or discipline: like ocean, land and/or physical ocanography, climate science etc. For the disciplines you can use the [Fields of Research codes](http://climate-cms.wikis.unsw.edu.au/Field_of_Research_codes) from the Bureau of statistics
* variable names: if you have many just list the more relevant
* spatiotemporal characteristic of the data: frequency, resolution, region covered
Every time you define a keyword you should favour terms provided in a vocabulary, the GCMD keywords for example will cover most of the categories listed above. If you are using a speciifc name as for datasets, models and projects, then use the official acronyms and specify the versions whenever possible.

Also remember that if a portal has a free text search any word in your title will be also used as a keyword, which is why it is useful to have a [descriptive title](http://climate-cms.wikis.unsw.edu.au/Descriptive_title) for your dataset or code.
