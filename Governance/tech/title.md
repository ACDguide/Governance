# Descriptive title

It is important to have a good title for your new data or code for publication. As you probably carefully choose a title for your papers, you should also try to put some effort in creating a good title for other research outputs. The title will be in any reference to your data or code.  While, depending on the repository you are using to publish, you can potentially change the title, even after a record has been published, it is important to get it right and be as descriptive as possible.

Also most people querying a repository will skim quickly through the list of returned records. All they will see initially is the title and the start of the description, until they actually click on one specific record.

And finally any word in the title is used as a keyword by free text search engine.

## Data example
"Weather Research and Forecasting (v3.6) model outputs from 2 km Kuala Lumpur urban climate experiments"

In the example above the author tried to include:

* the model name and version - Weather Research and Forecasting (v3.6)
* the kind of data - model outputs
* simulation resolution - from 2 km
* spatial domain - Kuala Lumpur
* subject - urban climate
* that there is more than 1 experiment - experiments
NB that having used the full model name rather than an acronym clarified to any user not familiar with WRF that this are weather forecast related experiments

## Code example
"CleF - Climate Finder a python based command line tool to query ESGF datasets hosted at NCI"

In the example above the author tried to include:

* the code acronym and full name: CleF - Climate Finder
* that it is python based - python
* that it is executed as a command line - command line tool
* what it does, including the data to which is applied: to query ESGF datasets
* the specific environment for which it was built: hosted at NCI
