# Climate Dataset Guidelines

This book is to provide guidelines for creating, managing, sharing and publishing climate data. With a focus on Australian climate research it has been designed to enable a common approach across the community.

Despite the focus on climate data, many of the principles and tools described within are applicable to many Earth science data applications.

This book will cover the follow topics:

## Creating climate data
Creating datasets that are fit for publication can be a daunting process, with many technical aspects to consider. This chapter will outline the ways to ensure that your data meets the broad [FAIR principles](https://ardc.edu.au/resources/working-with-data/fair-data/) of data sharing, along with specific requrirements and recommendations for climate-related data that will aid in the use and reproducibility of your data by the Australian, and international, climate community.

## Publishing climate data
Publishing data involves uploading them to an accessible respository, and having a persistent identifier (e.g. a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/)) attached in a similar manner to publishing a research paper. This data can then be used and references by other researchers, increasing the scientific impact your dataresearch-ready data can have. Additionally, many journals now require that data on which a paper is based be published in this manner. In this chapter, the various pathways to data publication are presented, with a focus on recommendations for those at Australian research institutions.

## Updating published climate data
As with all scientific outputs, errors and inconsistencies can be found in climate research data, oftentimes after publication. This chapter provides guidance to the updating of published data, along with recommendations for actions that can taken prior to the initial publication (such as good versioning practices) that can make this process much easier down the line, as published data may need to updated many times in its lifespan.


## Retiring published climate data
Data does last forever, usually becoming outdated or obsolete within 5-10 years; this of course is simply the nature of scientific research. In this chapter, recommendations are presented on how to go about retiring a published datase without breaking citations or removing identifiers, while retaining the value of your research data.
