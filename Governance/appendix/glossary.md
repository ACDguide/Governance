**CARE - Collective Benefit**
  Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.

**CARE - Authority to Control**
  Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered.

**CARE - Responsibility**
  Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self- determination and collective benefit.

**CARE - Ethics**
  Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.

**CC**
  [Creative Commons (CC)](https://creativecommons.org/) is a non-profit organisation that produces licenses to encourage sharing of knowledge, commonly used for data products. See also the [open access license](data-license) book page.

**CDM**
  Common Data Model (CDM) is an abstract data model for scientific datasets. This term can be used in different contexts. [Unidata’s Common Data Model](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/5.3/userguide/common_data_model_overview.html) merges the netCDF, {term}`OPeNDAP`, and HDF5 data models to create a common API for many types of scientific data. The NetCDF Java library is an implementation of the CDM which can read many file formats besides netCDF. Another example of CDM is the one developed by [Copernicus](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/how-to/15_how_to_understand_the_common_data_model/15_how_to_understand_the_common_data_model.html) to provide a uniform description (conventions, structures, formats etc.) of all data and products in their Climate Data Store.

**CDS**
  [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) provides access to a wide range of quality-assured climate datasets including observations, historical climate data records, estimates of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) derived from Earth observations, global and regional climate reanalyses of past observations, seasonal forecasts and climate projections. It is an initiative of the European Climate Change Service.

**CF conventions**
  The CF Climate and Forecast conventions are used to set metadata attributes in netCDF files. [See more](../concepts/cf-conventions.md)

**Citation**
  Citation is the way you attribute a piece of work, it should contain all the information necessary to locate the original work.

**CLEX**
  The ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes

**Copyright**
  Copyright is a form of intellectual property meant to protect the right of the author of a creative work to control how the work is used. More comprehensive but readable information on copyright is available [here](https://smartcopying.edu.au/guidelines/copyright-basics/what-is-copyright/).

**COSIMA**
  [COSIMA](https://cosima.org.au) is the Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia, which brings together Australian researchers involved in global ocean and sea ice modelling.

**DAP**
  DAP refers to the [Data Access Protocol](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esdis/esco/standards-and-practices/data-access-protocol-2) used by {term}`OPeNDAP`, it is a data transmission protocol designed specifically for science data. The protocol provides data types to accommodate gridded data, relational data, and time series, regardless of the original format. It is recognised by many scientific softwares, so you can pass a dap url instead of a filename to open a file or a subset.

**Data Archiving or Preservation**
  The process of putting your data in long term storage following the completion of a project or publication for a minimum of 5 years. This includes identifying who can access the data and how it can be accessed. Many institutions have repositories which can be used by staff and students.

**Data Back Up**
  The process of saving your data to protect against data loss. This can be an automatic process, where the storage location automatically retains previous versions of your data, or a manual process, where you need to actively save the data in another location. [See more](../concepts/backup.md)

**Data Sharing**
  Making your data available for use by other researchers for their own research projects. This requires quality metadata to determine data source and changes made to allow for reuse. The best way to share data is to publish it, then it will be more discoverable and will be assigned a persistent identifier (such as DOI) which helps others to cite the data.

**Data Storage**
  The location and/or system you use to store your data during a research project. This could include disk on personal computers, disk or tape on a shared server,  external storage devices such as hard drives or SD cards, and networked drives managed by your institution, commercial or research cloud storage.

**DMP**
  A Data Management Plan is a tool to help you manage the data for a specific research project. It can take different forms depending on the stage of your project, for example a DMP to submit with a grant application will be different from the DMP required to publish your data. A DMP evolves with your project and is useful to record your data provenance. [See more](../concepts/dmp.md)

**FAIR**
  The guiding principles often used in data governance are the FAIR principles of data sharing – Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. An extension to these are the FAIRER principles which add Ethical and Revisable to the acronym. [See more](../concepts/fairer-principles.md)

**FAIR - Findable**
  Data should be easy to find and identify. 

**FAIR - Accessible**
  Data should have open access whenever possible.

**FAIR - Interoperable**
  Well formatted data that uses discipline conventions and vocabularies, for both the data itself and the metadata used to describe it.

**FAIR - Reusable**
  Data should be accompanied by enough information on how it was collected or processed, as to guarantee its quality and hence make it usable by others.

**FAIRER - Ethical**
  Data should be ethical, its collection, distribution, and reuse should be done in a way that is respectful toward humans and the planet.

**FAIRER - Revisable**
  Data can require fixes or corrections, retraction and republication, or extensions. These potential fixes should be planned for.

**File Management**
  Methods for storing, organising, naming, discovering and retrieving files in a structured consistent manner. 

**GeoNetwork**
  [GeoNetwork](https://geonetwork-opensource.org/) is an open source web interface to serve geospatial data across multiple catalogs. {term}`NCI` uses a [GeoNetwork catalogue](http://geonetwork.nci.org.au/) to manage the metadata of data collections hosted on their servers.

**IMOS**
  The [Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)](https://imos.org.au) is an {term}`NCRIS` project that operates a wide range of observing equipment throughout Australia’s coastal and open oceans, making all of its data accessible to the marine and climate science community, other stakeholders and collaborators, via the {term}`AODN` portal.

**License**
  A copyright license is a legal document stating what someone else is allowed or not allowed to do with a research product.

**Metadata**
  The information on data. Examples are metadata files accompanying observations with details of instrumentations and location, or the attributes of a netCDF file. A metadata record or repositories will contain information on a dataset but not the data itself.

**NCI**
  The Australian [National Computational Infrastructure](https://nci.org.au) is a {term}`NCRIS` project whose aim is to provide high-performance data, storage and computing for all domains of science. It is the main HPC provider for the climate science community.

  A set of principles and a range of practices through which research outputs are distributed online, free of cost or other access barriers.

**OPeNDAP**
  The [Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP)](https://www.opendap.org/) is the client/server software associated to {term}`DAP`. OPeNDAP is a widely used, subsetting data access method extending the HTTP protocol. CLEX CMS has published a blog that demonstrates [how to build and use an opendap url](https://climate-cms.org/2019/01/18/using-opendap.html). Other more in depth information on OPenDAP is available from their [website](https://www.opendap.org/), including a list of software that understand this protocol.

**Provenance**
  Data provenance describes the journey data goes through. It documents the evolution of a dataset from the original source including all the processes and methodology by which it was produced. [See more](../concepts/provenance.md)

**Research Data Australia**
  [Research Data Australia RDA](https://researchdata.edu.au) is the data discovery service of {term}`ARDC`. Most universities and research centres across Australia are now listing their data collections on RDA. RDA does not hold the data, so it is often used instead to list records existing on other repositories. Universities and data centres often automatically create an RDA record for any newly published dataset. It is a useful tool for data, and more recently, for software discovery. RDA also holds records for research programs, institutions and the researchers themselves. Datasets listed on RDA are automatically added to the [google dataset search tool](http://climate-cms.wikis.unsw.edu.au/index.php?title=Google_dataset_search_tool&action=edit&redlink=1).

**TDS**
  The [THREDDS Data Server (TDS)](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/tds/) is a data and metadata catalogue server based on {term}`THREDDS`.{term}`NCI` uses a [THREDDS server](https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog.html) to make datasets available remotely.
