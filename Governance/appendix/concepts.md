# Key concepts   

(fair)=
```{dropdown} **The FAIR Data Principles**

* Findable:  data should be easy to find and identify. 
* Accessible: data should have open access whenever possible.
* Interoperable: well formatted data that uses discipline conventions and vocabularies, for both the data itself and the metadata used to describe it.
* Reusable: data should be accompanied by enough information on how it was collected or processed, as to guarantee its quality and hence make it usable by other

```{dropdown} **File Management**
Methods for storing, organising, naming, discovering and retrieving files in a structured consistent manner. 
```

```{dropdown} **Data Storage**
The location and/or system you use to store your data during a research project. This could include disk on personal computers, disk or tape on a shared server,  external storage devices such as hard drives or SD cards, and networked drives managed by your institution, commercial or research cloud storage.
```

```{dropdown} **Data Back Up**
The process of saving your data to protect against data loss. This can be an automatic process, where the storage location automatically retains previous versions of your data, or a manual process, where you need to actively save the data in another location.
```

```{dropdown} **Data Archiving or Preservation**
The process of putting your data in long term storage following the completion of a project or publication for a minimum of 5 years. This includes identifying who can access the data and how it can be accessed. Many Institutions have Repositories which can be used by staff and students.
```

```{dropdown} **Data Sharing**
Making your data available for use by other researchers for their own research projects. This requires quality metadata to determine data source and changes made to allow for reuse. The best way to share data is to publish it then it will be more discoverable and will be assigned a persistent identifier (such as DOI) which helps other to cite the data.
```

```{dropdown} **Data Provenance**
Data provenance describes the journey data goes through. It documents the evolution of a dataset from the original source including all the processes and methodology by which it was produced.
```

(dmp)=
```{dropdown} **Data Management Plan (DMP)**
A data management plan is a tool to help you manage the data for a specific research project. It can takes different forms depending on the stage of your project, for example a DMP to submit with a grant application will be different from the DMP required to publish your data. A DMP evolves with your project and it is useful to record your data provenance
```

```{dropdown} **Metadata**
Metadata is the information on data, examples are metadta files accompanying observations with details of instrumentations and location, the attributes of a NetCDF file. A metadata record or repositories will contain information on a dataset but not the data itself.
```

```{dropdown} **Open Access**
A set of principles and a range of practices through which research outputs are distributed online, free of cost or other access barriers.
```

```{dropdown} **attribution** 
Attribution is the act of recognising the author/s of a piece of work that you used in your research. It is a common requirement of licenses
```

```{dropdown} **citation**
Citation is the way you attribute a piece of work, it should contain all the information necessary to locate the original work
```

```{dropdown} **copyright**
Copyright is a form of intellectual property meant to protect the right of the author of a creative work to control how the work is used. More comprehensive but readable information on copyright is available [here](https://smartcopying.edu.au/guidelines/copyright-basics/what-is-copyright/).
```

```{dropdown} **license**
A copyright license is a legal document stating what someone else is allowed or not allowed to do with a research product
