```

(cosima)=
```{dropdown} **COSIMA - Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia**

```{dropdown} **DAP - Data Access Protocol**
DAP is a data transmission protocol designed specifically for science data. The protocol provides data types to accommodate gridded data, relational data, and time series, regardless of the original format. It is recognised by many scoentifc softwares, so you can pass a dap url instead of a filename to open a file or a subset.

(geonetwork)=
```{dropdown} **GeoNetwork**
[GeoNetwork](https://geonetwork-opensource.org/) is an open source web interface to serve geospatial data across multiple catalogs. NCI uses a [GeoNetwork catalogue](http://geonetwork.nci.org.au/) to manage the metadata of data collections hosted on their servers.

[NCSS](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/reference/NetcdfSubsetServiceReference.html) allows subsetting certain CDM datasets in coordinate space, using a REST API. Gridded data subsets can be returned in CF-compliant netCDF3 or netCDF4. Point data subsets can be returned in CSV, XML, or [CF-DSG](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#discrete-sampling-geometries) NetCDF files.

```

```{dropdown} **OGC - the Open Geospatial Consortium**

```

(opendap)=
```{dropdown} **OPeNDAP - Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol**
[OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org/) is the client/server software associated to DAP. OPeNDAP is a widely used, subsetting data access method extending the HTTP protocol. CLEX CMS haa published a blog that demonstrates [how to build and use and opendap url](https://climate-cms.org/2019/01/18/using-opendap.html), other more in depth information on OPenDAP is available from their [website](https://www.opendap.org/), including a list of software that understand this protocol.
```

(rdaustralia)=
```{dropdown} **RDA - Research Data Australia**
[RDA](https://researchdata.edu.au) is the data discovery service of the [Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)](ardc). Most universities and research centers across Australia are now listing their data collections on RDA. RDA does not hold the data, so it is often used instead to list records existing on other repositories. Universities and data centers often automatically create an RDA record for any new published dataset. It is a useful tool for data, and more recently, for software discovery. RDA also holds record for research programs, institution and the researchers themselves. Datasets listed on RDA are automatically added to the [google dataset search tool](http://climate-cms.wikis.unsw.edu.au/index.php?title=Google_dataset_search_tool&action=edit&redlink=1).
```

(rdalliance)=
```{dropdown} **RDA - Research Data Alliance**
[RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/) is a global community-driven initiative with the goal of building the social and technical infrastructure to enable open sharing and re-use of data.

```{dropdown} **TERN -**
```

(thredds)=
```{dropdown} **THREDDS - Thematic Real-Time Environmental Distributed Data Services**
THREDDS provides metadata and data access for scientific datasets, using a variety of remote data access protocols, including DAP. NCI uses a [THREDDS server](https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog.html) to make datasets available remotely. Our CLEX and ARCCSS collection are also available on this. A list of other useful THREDDS data servers is available from our data access page.
