# Guidelines to manage climate dataset

These guidelines are aimed to dataset managers and cover all aspects of managing an authoritative or a replicated dataset on a local server.
Some of examples we show here are NCI based as this is where we managed most of our data. Hopefully the examples can still be extrapolated to other platforms. 
data custodians and stewards in technical data management at NCI:

Project handling 
  writers group creation
  use of posix permissions
  use of ACLs
  caveats with ACLs - what breaks them and when do they break?
Note, this is NCI specific content - on CSIRO internal resources e.g., access mgmt is governed by windows ACLs - email schelp for advice.
