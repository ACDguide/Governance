# Guidelines to manage climate dataset

These guidelines are aimed to data custodians and cover all aspects of managing an authoritative or a replicated dataset on a local server.
These guidelines are NCI based as this is where most of Australian climate data is hosted. Hopefully the advice given here can still be extrapolated to other platforms.
