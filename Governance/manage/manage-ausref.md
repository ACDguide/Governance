# Australian Community Reference Climate Data Collection @ NCI

This collection is a collaboration between the Australian Climate Service (ACS), ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes (CLEX) and the wider Australian climate research community to re-establish and maintain a reference dataset collection at NCI.
We chose this collection as one of our use case as we are directly involved in managing this collection. But most importantly because one of the aims of this collection is to provide the climate community with well-documented, easy to discover and easy to access datasets. The collection has been launched in July 2022 and it is still growing.

## Code management

## Directory structure

## Documentation

Each dataset has its own associated GitHub repository, as mentioned above, to create a catalogue for the collection, as well as to have one place where the collection scope and management are described. We set up a [Jupyter book](https://aus-ref-clim-data-nci.github.io/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/intro.html), as well as containing an introduction and the governance of the collection, including how other members of the climate community can contribute to it. The READMe.md files of each dataset are used to create a list of the datasets documentation.

## Listing on online data portal

The datasets included in the collection are all replicas, as such we cannot publish a record on a climate related repository or on teh NCI geonetwork catalogue. However, we listed each dataset in a new Australian Climate Data portal, this is also managed by the climate community and accept any record. The portal cannot mint new DOI but can list both published datasets with an exsiting DOI and replicated datasets. We created a record for each dataset ( or more than one where dataset had different versions available), each record shows the documentation, where to find the data at NCI, has links to the original official documentation and lists where available the original DOIs.
