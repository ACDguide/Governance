# File organisation

## Managing downloads

Bash script are ok if the downloads are quite simple, if there is a lot of shuffling of files and directories to do, soon bash become unruly and you'll find you have to use obscure directive to reproduce data structure which are default for other languages
We use a lot of python codes as soon as a diownload code becomes unwielding with bash

python has lots of modules that can help with downloads as ftp, requests (hndles web requests and also authentication) etc beautiful soup to scrape webpages
modules that helps with file system management like os. and sys, logging to handle different levels of logs
Data structure like dictionaries that helps mapping terms


## Following original structure

## Adapting to internal workflow

## Data downloaded on request
