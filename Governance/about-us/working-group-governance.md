# Working Group Governance

The “climate dataset guidelines working group” is a collaboration between scientists within the Australian climate community. Participation is self-nominated and voluntary. Anyone is welcome to join the group or contribute independently to this Jupyter Book. This document outlines the governance of the big data working group. The group’s goals is to provide guidelines to create, manage and share climate data in order to have a common approach across the Australian climate research community. The group meets once per month, and works collaboratively to organize and create the Jupyter Book.

## Statement of Scope

The goal of this working group is to create and share a best-practices framework for climate-related scientists in Australia who create datasets for the purposes of sharing and publication. The framework will be collated and shared in the form of a Jupyter Book, made using a public github repository (https://github.com/ACDguide/Governance). 

Contents include:
- Creating climate data for sharing & publication
- Publishing climate data & publication options 
- Updating published climate data
- Retiring published climate
- Data management concepts

## Working Group Origins
This working group grew out of a workshop “Creating a collaborative approach to climate data” at the AMOS (Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society) Annual Conference 2021. 

There are three other working groups that are closely related:
- Creation of a single catalogue and/or access point for climate data
- Enabling access of collections across institutions
- Working with big/challenging data collections
