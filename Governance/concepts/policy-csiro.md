## CSIRO Code of Conduct ##

The [CSIRO Code of Conduct](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/policies/code-of-conduct) states the following:

>In conducting science, you will:
>* communicate research methodology, data and findings accurately, responsibly and where appropriate openly and broadly, taking action to correct the record in a timely manner when it is necessary;
>* properly manage and protect CSIROâ€™s intellectual property and research data and materials retaining clear, accurate, secure and * complete records of all research including research data and primary materials and where possible and appropriate, allowing access and reference to these by interested parties;
>* respect and properly manage the intellectual property and research data and materials of others;

> You will maintain confidentiality of information, including commercial information, of CSIRO and others. Confidential information includes new knowledge or research data which has not been approved for publication.

## CSIRO's Management of Research Data ##

Management of research data and software at CSIRO is guided by the principles set out in the document, [CSIRO's Management of Research Data](https://my.csiro.au/Policy-Portal/IMT/CSIRO-Management-of-Research-Data) (CSIRO staff access only).

The core principles are:
1. Data are a critical asset for CSIRO
2. CSIRO's research data are to be open and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) unless otherwise agreed
3. There are obligations that come with data
4. Data should be managed through its life from creation to publication,archiving or deletion.

CSIRO's Management of Research Data explains:

* the value of research data for CSIRO, and for science more broadly
* principles that can be used to guide decisions about management of research data
* obligations associated with working with data at CSIRO
* broad guidelines for practical aspects of managing data at CSIRO.
