# Open Access License

If you are sharing your data or code freely, you might be wondering why you should be using a license, but making your data freely available to others doesn't mean that you shouldn't establish in which way it can be used. This is where open access licenses come in handy and this is why you can have different flavours of the same open-access license.

Licenses are really useful for both the "data" creator and the user, it helps a potential user to work out quickly if the data is suitable for their intended use and helps them citing and using the data in the way the creator intended.
Here we summarise the licenses we commonly use. For a much more detailed view of these licenses, ARDC (the Australian Research Data Commons) has a comprehensive guide which covers also copyright.

The important thing to understand about copyright is that it is usually held by or shared with your own institution. Projects or consortiums are not a legal entity and your institution has the Intellectual Property of your work (see below). In cases of collaborative projects among different institutions, often who will be holding the copyright is determined before the start of the project.
When you apply a license to your data, you are doing so on behalf of your institution. Most institutions have an open-access policy and would be fine with an open-access license unless there are particular circumstances around your data, for example, if it is already covered by an agreement or is of a sensitive nature. If you are in doubt, check with your institution research office if they are fine with the license you want to use.

## Common license rules
Before looking at the different flavours of licenses, we need to understand what they are covering. First of all, these are all open-access licenses so by applying one of them, you are usually giving free access to your data which means that you are not charging for using your data. However, you can regulate how a potential user can access and use your data. Usually, a license will cover some or all of the following points:

* Attribution: a user is required to cite and/or acknowledge your data, this is usually included in any license. You should make sure you are sharing the information on how to cite the data.
* Commercial use and/or research use: you can limit the use of your data to research only or exclude any commercial use of your data.
* Distribution vs private use: if a user can distribute your data/software or can only use it for their own work
* License and copyright notice: a copy of the license and copyright has to be included with the data or software.
* Modification: a user can modify, augment or transform your data to create a new dataset or software
* Same license: the dataset or software resulting from modification of yours has to be distributed under the same license, so they cannot restrict the use of their derived product.
* No-Derivatives: if a user modifies, augments or transforms the data in any way they cannot redistribute it. This can be changed of course if they get in contact with the creator and the creator allows an exception. In fact, this clause is often added only so the creator can be kept informed on how the data is used rather than a strict restriction on derivatives.

The following two points apply only to software:

* Disclose source: source code must be made available when derived product is distributed
* State changes: any changes made must be documented
Finally licenses usually contain a disclaimer to cover warranty and liability, i.e. that the data or software is provided "as is" and that the copyright owner cannot be considered responsible for any damages derived by using the product.

```{note} CC-BY 4.0
As you can see there are a lot of different flavours possible. Usually, any license will cover "attribution" which is the most common reason to apply a license: to get your work recognised! If you are unsure which license to use, we advise using the International CC-BY 4.0 license.
